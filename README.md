# Expanded Gridmenu for BAR
Expand your Grid menu from 3x4 panel to 3x6 grid menu panel for BAR (Beyond All Reason)! 

This widget is to help alleviate the 2nd page unit syndrome, where units get forgotten for just being on the 2nd page of factory/build menus.

> [!NOTE]
> Still a WIP for toggable option to switch between Grid menu & Expanded Grid menu in Custom settings.

# Features
- Expands the Grid menu panel from 3x4 to 3x6 panel to allow an extra 6 slot visibility in grid menu.

# Known Issue
You will have to delete/move `gui_gridmenu.lua` out of the Widgets folder to go back to old `3x4 Grid menu panel.`  Until myself or someone else is able figure out to make it toggleable to switch between 3x4 & 3x6 Grid menus panels.
